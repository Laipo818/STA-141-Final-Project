# STA-141-Final-Project
In this final project, we aim to develop a predictive model using a subset of neural data collected by Steinmetz et al. Our analysis focuses on four selected mice, with model performance assessed on two independent test sets, each comprising 100 trials randomly sampled from Session 1 and Session 18. Specifically, we analyze the spike trains of neurons recorded from stimulus onset to 0.4 seconds post-onset to characterize underlying neural activity patterns. By leveraging statistical modeling techniques, we seek to extract meaningful insights from neural spike data and evaluate the model’s robustness and generalizability across varying experimental conditions. Furthermore, we will rigorously evaluate our model’s accuracy to ensure its reliability and predictive performance.
